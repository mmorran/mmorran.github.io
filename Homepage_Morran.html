<h3>I always wonder where to begin.</h3>
<p>Before starting this homepage, I was unsure what to write at the top. A heading? Is hello adequate? Welcome? Verga stated, in his introduction to Gramigna's Mistress, "I shall merely tell you how it began and how it ended, which is all you need to know." Beginnings have always been confusing to me. I constantly wonder where to begin. For this current "homepage," the beginning is arbitrary. However, here is what I will say: the Soviet filmmaker Lev Kuleshov developed a technique that is now ubiquitous throughout the world of montage film. That technique is titled the Moszhukin experiment. In this experiment, Kuleshov showed how emotion can be created through editing processes. He captured images of a man with a neutral expression and then followed those neutral expressions with various other images. For example, the man's face was first followed by an image of food, therefore signifying to the audience that he was hungry. However, if the man was followed by an image of a young woman, he was then attached to feelings of sexual desire. Let's take another look at how this could work. Presented with <a href= "http://static.conservativetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/donald-trump-neutral.jpg">Image A</a> we see a man with a neutral expression. (However, one must understand that he is not exactly a neutral man, but let's continue with the example). When <a href= "http://static.conservativetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/donald-trump-neutral.jpg">Image A</a> is followed by <a href="http://www.dumpaday.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/cow-stuck-on-a-fence-funny-pictures.jpg"> Image B</a>, well then we're getting somewhere. (<a href= "http://static.conservativetribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/donald-trump-neutral.jpg">Image A</a> now becomes <a href= "http://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/pasadenademocrats/pages/530/meta_images/original/trump-smirk.jpg?1472237241">Image A'</a> in our minds). This example is relevant to the idea of a beginning. Beginnings confuse me, because I always wish to know what preceeded them. For without the picture of the man, we are left with many more questions about the cow stuck on the fence (wall). In order to create some form of adequate beginning, which really isn't a beginning at all, I'll add in a few other details.</p>

<H3>a bit about me -</H3>
<p>I used to be very afraid of sharks (and for the most part still am).</p>

<p>I also used to be very afraid of heights (but I got over that fear shortly after being sent to a rock climbing camp at a young age).</p>

<p>I visited Mount Rushmore when I was in second grade. My family drove up from Texas because my mother doesn’t particularly enjoy flying.</p>

<p>In my free time, I like to watch movies and am constantly contemplating whether I currently have enough perspective to write for film. Now, I’m just trying to understand what perspective really means.</p>
