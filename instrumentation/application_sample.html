	<p>Ways to not put your foot in your mouth -</p>
</div>
<p>I. When interacting with plants - </p>
	<p>The topics of global warming or greenhouse gases will probably not get you far. Try not to mention pesticides, GMOs, or your overwhelming fear of christmas tree farms. Finally, do your best not to mention your general fear of being reincarnated as a plant, they won’t take it well. </p>

<p>II. When interacting with animals - </p>
	<p>If you meet a new dog for the first time, do not discuss the cat that lives next door or the squirrel that frequents your bird feeder in the backyard. When conversing with a young fish do not ask any questions about gill size. When newly acquainted with an old cat, do not ask about her children, her spouse, any of her nine lives, or her unhealthy love of ranch dressing. When you’re swimming next to a killer whale, do not (under any circumstance) mention Sea World. And, if you’re ever in a room with an elephant, get out.</p>

<p>III. When interacting with humans - </p>
	<p>Never, ever, offer to run someone else’s political campaign (especially if you do not know them). When meeting someone new do not use gender specific pronouns and do not use any of the following words: proctology, cocksucker, or “I fucking hate ____.” Before commenting on the smell of an environment first confirm if your older sister, roommate or someone else in the immediate vicinity has been cooking any of the following: tuna salad, egg salad, or broccoli. If ever at a family reunion with Ben Carson fanatics, avoid the topic of religion at all cost. Before receiving a present from someone keep any conversation about inanimate objects entirely neutral. When interacting with a divorcee, do not mention anything about a happy marriage, their ex-spouse, or dating.  If ever at a family’s home for dinner, put a little of everything on your plate unless you are: vegetarian, vegan, paleo, gluten free, or allergic. Never spit into your napkin or pretend to eat, rather politely mention the small size of your stomach and quickly pass your full plate to your nearest relative (preferably husband). When on a first date, keep your bedroom habits strictly under wraps and do not say a word about penis or boob size preferences. If ever at a restaurant, withhold all complaints until the end of the meal. Never guess the sexual orientation of a new acquaintance. When playing board games with professors, academics, or any other highly intelligent humans do not assume that any of them have written “Of Grammatology” (even if they make frequent reference to the work as if it’s their own). If unsure of what someone else said, do not immediately try to fill the awkward silence by saying: “thank you” or “you’re welcome,” instead, you must politely nod or ask them to repeat themselves. And if anything goes awry immediately revert to a safe topic by restricting your conversations to “the conditions of the road and the weather.” </p>

<p>IV. When conversing with the innermost parts of yourself - </p>
	<p>There are eight topics that are strictly off limits. They are detailed below: </p>
<p>
<ol>
<li>death (in any capacity and especially after dark)</li>
<li>body image, the size of anything sticking off of any part of yourself, or that huge piece of cake you ate too fast yesterday</li>
<li>your anxiety and your anxiety about your anxiety </li>
<li>outer space (especially around 11:00pm or later)</li>
<li>your fear of snake attacks or that man who accidentally got into your car outside of a post office when you were nine</li>
<li>your first awkward sexual encounter</li>
<li>your fear of being inadequate</li>
<li>and worst of all - that one time you put your foot in your mouth</li>
</ol>

	<h3>Why I Want To Take the Class:</h3>
</div>
<p>I’m a rising junior concentrating in Modern Culture and Media Track II. In high school, I began working on short film projects with my friends. Back then, we all participated in every step of the process from pre-production to the final product. Those projects sparked my interest in three specific areas of film production: writing, cinematography, and editing. At Brown I have started to focus on those three aspects of the process when working on my own projects both inside and outside the classroom. Last spring, I began to rethink representation in film and my presentation of ideas. I was eager to find an outlet to create more experimental work. I took Digital Language Art I with Todd Anderson and began to work on short film projects that involved the interaction of text and digital media. Inspired by the first weeks of the class when Todd introduced us to random word generators, I became interested in new ways of writing. For my final project “A Brief History of How Life Works,” I wanted to incorporate text in a unique way, still feeling inspired by the word generation classes. I turned to YouTube comments and including snippets of various comments over specific stock footage, often including multiple authors (writers of the comments), but giving the appearance of one. Additionally, I have become interested in concepts related to the uncanny valley. I have started to incorporate text-to-speech voice-over narration and stock footage. Simultaneously, I also attempt to  keep the content of the work intimate, vulnerable, and human. The threshold between the natural and the unnatural is my favorite area to explore. </p>
	
	<p>Writing3D peaked my interest, because I want to continue with the Digital Language Art courses offered to undergraduates and I would love the opportunity to create work that incorporates virtual reality. I recognize that virtual reality work is on the rise, so I would love, not only to keep up with the new technology, but to also have a chance to go deeper in my exploration of work that deals with concepts relating to the uncanny valley. VR certainly exists in the liminal space between the natural and the unnatural and I cannot wait to see what work can be made with such processes. </p>
