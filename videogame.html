<h1>The Purloined Letter</h1>
<h2>A video game inspired by The Purloined Letter, a short story by Edgar Allan Poe.</h2>
<p>Goal/Purpose: The form of the game is meant to complement Poe's short story, which engages in questions of seeing and knowing. What is truly seen? What is truly known? What is hidden, yet simultaneously right in front of us? In attempt to capture the complexities of this story, the player gets to experience three parts of Poe's narrative (three different rooms) as different characters. Each character brings new insight to the scenes and it is the culmination of many ways of knowing and thinking in the game that allows the player to finally reach the end and find the missing letter.</p>
<h2>Here is a character list:</h2>
<p>1. Detective</p>
<p>2. Head of the Police</p>
<p>3. Queen</p>
<p>4. King</p>

<h2>Here are the secondary characters:</h2>
<p>1. Poe</p>
<p>2. The Sender of the Letter</p>
<p>note - A player is able to become Poe at the end of the game. The player can talk to the sender of the letter, but is not able to become the sender of the letter.</p>
<p>note.2 - There is a narrator primarily for stylistic reasons. He can reveal small clues intermittently.</p>

<h2>The primary goal is to find:</h2>
<p>The letter</p>

<h2>The setting is a hallway with access to three rooms:</h2>
<p>1. Room 1 - Where the letter is initially stolen (on the left side of the hallway)</p>
<p>2. Room 2 - Where the letter is hidden (on the right side of the hallway)</p>
<p>3. Room 3 - Where the police reveals the crime to the detective (at the end of the hallway)</p>

<p>The goal of the game is to find the stolen letter (the way this is done is discussed below). When the letter is finally found at the end, a fourth room is revealed and an additional character enters the hallway: Poe. The player has the option of becomming Poe and Poe is free to wander the remnants of his story. In the fourth room he can talk to the sender of the letter. In order for the game to start over, the player must walk around enough, exploring each room at least three times and engaging in a conversation consisting of at least ten decisions with the sender (this will be similar to conversations in Unammed or 80 Days, there will be options like in Twine) - then a set of stairs are revealed in the fourth room, allowing Poe's character to walk outside and onto a spiral, you can walk up one part of the spiral and re-enter the starting hallway to begin again. The spiral has no ending. Poe cannot jump off of the spiral or go beyond or outside the spiral.</p>

<p>The structure of the game: You can be any of the starting characters (1-4). Similar to twine stories, the experiences in this game differ based on the character that the player chooses (this is similar to picking a character to follow in a VR film, for example.) The form of this game is meant to mirror the different modes of thinking of the characters in Poe's short story. 

Here is an example of time spent in room 1: 

Each room consists of a <a href= "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLL7aIi154Q">selective attention test</a> - There are 20 changes that reveal clues-

Each character has the ability to interact with a certain number of the changes.</p>

<p>Detective (first time through) - 2 things, (second time through) 3 things, (third time through) 2 things</p>
<p>Head of Police (first time through) - 1 thing,  (second time through) 2 things, (third time through) 1 thing</p>
<p>Queen (first time through) - 3 things, (second time through) 1 thing, (third time through) 0 things</p>
<p>King (first time through) - 1 thing, (second time through) 3 things, (third time through) 1 thing</p>

<p>After each version of the selective attention test, the player is able to pick up or click on the number of things their character was able to observe, you can then go out into the hallway and ask one character about the things you observed. After engaging in a conversation about the thing observed, you become that character and go back into the room. 

There are similar structures for each of the consecutive rooms. 

This design is a way of simulating the different modes of thinking that are present in the Poe short story. The head of the police is unable to find the letter (in the story), due to his strictly empirical thinking. The detective must engage in lateral thinking in order to see what was initially unseen. Ideally, the game would be coded to remember how many times each character explored a room and what they found. The game would then reveal new information each time in each room.

The goal is to find the letter in the second room. Then the played may become Poe and explore the depths of the game universe.</p>

<h2>Here is an example of the aesthetic (since this is a proposal, I figured: go big or go home):</h2>

<p>At the end of the game, the player may become Poe and can freely explore the space. While the design will not change specifically (except in the final spiral location), the feeling evoked will be more similar to that of some of the endings of The Stanley Parable or The Inside of a Dead Skyscraper. Here are some picture references.</p>

<p>Controls: Characters can look around with this mouse, items in the rooms can be clicked on and (depending on the characters number of revelations in the selective attention test scenes) information can be gathered. To engage in a conversation with other characters space bar is used. To switch bodies, press the up arrow.</p>
